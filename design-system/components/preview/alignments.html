<h2>Alignments</h2>

<p>Elements can be aligned left and right within the normal flow of paragraph content using the classes <code>align-left</code> and <code>align-right</code>. Where no specific size is selected, they'll default to <strong>medium</strong>
  width. This is normally fine.</p>
<p>As these elements are floated, <strong>always make sure there is enough copy to flow all the way around the element to 'clear' it.</strong>

<h2>Sizes</h2>

<p>Elements can be given a size to restrict their width. Normally you don't need to, but if you want to make something explicitly larger or smaller than its default width when aligned, add:</p>

<ul class="list--unstyled">
  <li><code>size-</code></li>
  <li><code>size-</code></li>
  <li><code>size-</code></li>
</ul>

<p>It's normally a good idea to delay adding a heading until you've added enough copy to clear a left-aligned figure, else it can look weird.</p>
