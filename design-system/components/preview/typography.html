<h1 class="title">Typography</h1>

<h2>Typeface</h2>
<p>One typeface is used for the web, there is no secondary typeface:</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="font-primary">Roboto - Primary typeface</span>: is the default for body copy and headings</li>

</ul>



<h2>Typescale</h2>

<p>The following sizes are defined in <code>__vars/_typography.scss</code> to set a typescale.</p>
<p>This will <strong>only</strong> change the <strong>font-size</strong></p>

<ul class="list-unbulleted">
    <li class="font-6xl">6xl: The biggest font-size <span class="font-caption">4 (rem)</span></li>
    <li class="font-5xl">5xl: The second biggest size <span class="font-caption">3 (rem)</span></li>
    <li class="font-4xl">4xl: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog <span class="font-caption">2.5 (rem)</span></li>
    <li class="font-3xl">3xl: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog <span class="font-caption">2 (rem)</span></li>
    <li class="font-2xl">2xl: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog <span class="font-caption">1.5 (rem)</span></li>
    <li class="font-xl">xl: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog <span class="font-caption">1.25 (rem)</span></li>
    <li class="font-lg">lg: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog <span class="font-caption">1.125 (rem)</span></li>
    <li class="font-md">md: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog <span class="font-caption">1 (rem)</span></li>
    <li class="font-sm">sm: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog <span class="font-caption">0.875 (rem)</span></li>
    <li class="font-xs">xs: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog <span class="font-caption">0.75 (rem)</span></li>
    <li class="font-2xs">2xs: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog <span class="font-caption">0.6875 (rem)</span></li>
</ul>

<p>They can be used using a class of <code>font-<em>[sizename]</em></code>, eg. <code>font-2xl</code><br/>
    or in Sass using <code>@include typescale('<em>[sizename]</em>');</code>, eg. <code>@include typescale('xs');</code></p>


<hr/>

<h2>Heading Levels</h2>

<p>Use semantic heading level elements (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>-<code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>) for content, do <strong>not</strong> use these elements for their visual appearance.</p>
<p>They can be sized by applying a class above, eg. <code>&lt;h2 class="font-xl"&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>To make a non-heading element appear in a heading style (including font-family), a class of <code>h1</code>-<code>h6</code> can be applied. eg. <code>&lt;div class="h3"&gt;</code></p>
<p>Headings are assigned one of the Typescale sizes in <code>__vars/_typography.scss</code>.</p>

<div class="h1">h1 Default: 5xl</div>
<div class="h2">h2 Default: 4xl</div>
<div class="h3">h3 Default: 3xl</div>
<div class="h4">h4 Default: 2xl</div>
<div class="h5">h5 Default: xl</div>
<div class="h6">h6 Default: lg</div>

<p><strong>£2600</strong> is an amount of money that I've wrapped some <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tags around, while <strong>4 weeks</strong> – a length of time – also has had the same treatment for the purposes of just <em>testing</em> how typography appears on the page. Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
