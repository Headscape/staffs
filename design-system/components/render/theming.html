<h2>Colour</h2>

<p>Colour plays the primary <i>(geddit?)</i> role for applying a theme layer, or alternate brand skin to the component library. As mentioned in the docs for Colour, abstraction is key.</p>
<p>We'll take the Digital Institute London (LDN) skin as an example.</p>
<p>To create this, we've set up an alternate Sass file: <code>main-ldn.scss</code>. We set up the alternate colours we want to use, and then simply import components, because we've nicely built all our components with abstracted colour variables (hopefully).</p>

<p>We pick <code>$primary</code>, <code>$secondary</code>, and <code>$tertiary</code> colours, and the theme also uses an abstracted <code>$neutral--primary</code> and <code>$neutral--light</code>, to avoid using <code>$slate</code> directly from the main Staffs palette, which might not be suitable for sub-themes.</p>

<pre>
$primary:                     $blue--deep-ldn;
$secondary:                   $purple--deep-ldn;
$tertiary:                    $magenta--ldn;
$neutral--primary:            $granite--ldn;
$neutral--light:              $granite--light-ldn;
</pre>

<h2>Key Themeable Components</h2>

<p>There are a number of key themable components which have different colour variants to bring in more of a brand's palette, notably:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="../detail/title--examples.html" target="_top">Titles</a></li>
  <li><a href="../detail/card--flex.html" target="_top">Cards</a></li>
  <li><a href="../detail/tile--accent-colours.html" target="_top">Tiles</a> <small>(and <a href="../detail/feature-tiles--default.html" target="_top">Feature Tiles</a>)</small></li>
  <li><a href="../detail/slab--examples.html" target="_top">Slabs</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these has a Sass map of colours, from which variants are created, as demonstrated in the docs for <a href="../detail/colour.html" target="_top">Colour</a>.</p>

<h2>Exceptions</h2>

<p>Consider carefully the need for 'exceptions' or additional variants. <strong>Avoid where possible</strong>.</p>
<p>If a component doesn't work well with a sub-theme, the chances are, it's the main component that needs adapting to be more flexible, rather than an override or exception being made for the sub-theme.</p>
<p>For example, a key part of the LDN brand is use of the clipped corner from the logo. To introduce this, a 'clipped' button style was added to the main component library, to benefit all sub-themes.</p>
