<h1 class="title">Typography</h1>

<h2>Typeface</h2>
<p>Two typefaces are used for the web</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="font-primary">Arial - Primary typeface</span>: is the default for body copy</li>
    <li><span class="font-secondary">Museo Sans - Secondary typeface</span>: for headings and other 'decorative' copy.</li>
</ul>

<p>They can be used using a class of <code>font-primary</code> or <code>font-secondary</code><br/>
    or in Sass using <code>@include font-primary;</code> or <code>@include font-secondary;</code></p>

<h2>Typescale</h2>

<p>The following sizes are defined in <code>__vars/_typography.scss</code> to set a typescale.</p>
<p>This will <strong>only</strong> change the <strong>font-size</strong></p>

<ul class="list-unbulleted">
    <li class="font-6xl">6xl: The biggest font-size <span class="font-caption">4 (rem)</span></li>
    <li class="font-5xl">5xl: The second biggest size <span class="font-caption">3 (rem)</span></li>
    <li class="font-4xl">4xl: {{ pangram }} <span class="font-caption">2.5 (rem)</span></li>
    <li class="font-3xl">3xl: {{ pangram }} <span class="font-caption">2 (rem)</span></li>
    <li class="font-2xl">2xl: {{ pangram }} <span class="font-caption">1.5 (rem)</span></li>
    <li class="font-xl">xl: {{ pangram }} <span class="font-caption">1.25 (rem)</span></li>
    <li class="font-lg">lg: {{ pangram }} <span class="font-caption">1.125 (rem)</span></li>
    <li class="font-md">md: {{ pangram }} <span class="font-caption">1 (rem)</span></li>
    <li class="font-sm">sm: {{ pangram }} <span class="font-caption">0.875 (rem)</span></li>
    <li class="font-xs">xs: {{ pangram }} <span class="font-caption">0.75 (rem)</span></li>
    <li class="font-2xs">2xs: {{ pangram }} <span class="font-caption">0.6875 (rem)</span></li>
</ul>

<p>They can be used using a class of <code>font-<em>[sizename]</em></code>, eg. <code>font-2xl</code><br/>
    or in Sass using <code>@include typescale('<em>[sizename]</em>');</code>, eg. <code>@include typescale('xs');</code></p>


<hr/>

<h2>Heading Levels</h2>

<p>Use semantic heading level elements (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>-<code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>) for content, do <strong>not</strong> use these elements for their visual appearance.</p>
<p>They can be sized by applying a class above, eg. <code>&lt;h2 class="font-xl"&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>To make a non-heading element appear in a heading style (including font-family), a class of <code>h1</code>-<code>h6</code> can be applied. eg. <code>&lt;div class="h3"&gt;</code></p>
<p>Headings are assigned one of the Typescale sizes in <code>__vars/_typography.scss</code>.</p>

<div class="h1">h1 Default: 5xl</div>
<div class="h2">h2 Default: 4xl</div>
<div class="h3">h3 Default: 3xl</div>
<div class="h4">h4 Default: 2xl</div>
<div class="h5">h5 Default: xl</div>
<div class="h6">h6 Default: lg</div>
